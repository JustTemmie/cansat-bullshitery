this code is rather scuffed, it was written mostly in the span of like 2 days by me and a classmate trying to get this silly idea to work.

TFB is a school project some people in my class including me have, it stands for The Falling Beaver and our objective is to launch an aluminium box a km into the air whilst we have a computer on the ground playing pong against it :)

Temmie was responsible for most of the python work, whilst Henwee did the C stuff
